# COVID-19-Risk-Assessment-Tool
This repository contains the source code for the iSchool's COVID-19 Risk Assessment Tool.  

We propose the building and creation of a risk assessment tool focused on helping young adults assess their  risk of being exposed to and spreading COVID-19. More specifically, we propose creating a responsive, web- based tool that helps young adults assess risk associated with realistic social scenarios and provides them with  actionable steps for risk mitigation. Though the target population for this technology is young adults (based on increased outbreaks within this age group), the goal would be to build this technology in an accessible way for all residents to be able to interact.
